# Week 5 – Spring Microservices

This folder contains the Week 5 hands-on for the Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE Deep Skilling Program.  
It covers:

- Building two microservices (`account-service`, `loan-service`)
- Registering them with a central Eureka Server
- Routing through an API Gateway

Both **Exercise 1** and **Exercise 2** are combined into a single working implementation.
